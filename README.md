# NLP_DrinkSurvey
Determining if the responses in the survey showed that the surveyee is a wine drinker or not, based on a series of behavioural, opinion and situational type questions to understand the respondent better. Surveys were recorded verbally through Otter.AI as well as through Google Survey document.

Leveraged key Natural Language Processing and visualization libraries in R to run correlation analysis, different sentimental analyses (NRC, Bing, AFINN), bi-grams and relevance based on token frequency inverse document frequency (TF-IDF). Utilized probabilistic classifier, Naive Bayes, to classify the survey results as well as compare the accuracy of the model to actual responses.
